## Diagram Descriptions
- D0 Explanation:
In this Diagram we have three components we have a Database Manager who provides inputs to the application. The web application will take the inputs and commmunicate the changes desired by the database manager to the database. The DataBase also provides the data to be displayed to the web application.

- D1 Explanation:
In this Diagram we have the Front End of the web app providing data entry and login information to the backend. The backend then populates metainformation and makes the neccessary queries to the database. The MongoDB database then provides the data to the back-end which then sends it to be displayed on the front-end. The Back-End also provides the front-end authentication responses whenever someone attempts to login.

- D2 Description:
Here we have a login page that a user would input their username and password into. This information is then sent to the back-end for authentication which in turn gives back it's response. Once Logged in the user will land at the All Objects Page this page recieves the data to be displayed from the back-end javascript query API. The user can then pick a specific document to edit thus landing at the object editor page. This object editor page provides a user interface to make edits to the data and when the user presses the save button the web app will use the query API in the backend to make the desired changes to the database.
