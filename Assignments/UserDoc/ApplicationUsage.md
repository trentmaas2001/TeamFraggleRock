# Document Viewing Page

This page displays a table where each row represents a document within the collection on your database. Each row will show some information held within your database and there will be an actions column holding buttons that when pressed take you to a web page that allows you to make edits to the document in that row.

# Document Editing Page

This page allows the user to view and edit the document chosen from the Dcument Viewing Page.

The table represents the chosen document by having the key value pairs held within the document in each row. The keys are displayed in the Keys column and the values for these keys are displayed in the same row under the Value column.

The most important feature of this page is the Save button. Any Added/Deleted/Edited Values will not be reflected within your database until this button is pressed.

To make an edit to a key or value, simply change the text in the text box to the desired value and hit the Save button.

To add a new Key-Value pair to the document hit the Add Button enter the desired key and value to the newly created textbox and hit save. The application will not save an empty key to the database.

Each row has an Actions column that allows you to make some custom actions for that row. Currently there is a Delete button that deletes the row. This does not delete the value from the database until you hit save.
